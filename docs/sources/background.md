## Background
1. Chado schema
   * Schema is stable. 
   * Does not have default versioning system
2. We will have to make changes to default schema. It should be possible for us to make changes upstream
   * e.g - If we make changes on default schema today, and the schema changes tomorrow; we should be able to keep track of all changes
3. __We are NOT doing data versioning, ONLY schema versioning__
